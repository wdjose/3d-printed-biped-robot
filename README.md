# 3D-Printed Biped Robot
This repository contains the 3D model and the source code for the 3D-printed biped robot presented in the conference: 

> [W. J. D. Jose and M. C. Ramos, "Development of a 3D-printed biped robot with distributed joint control," 2018 4th International Conference on Control, Automation and Robotics (ICCAR), Auckland, 2018, pp. 71-75.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8384647/ "Development of a 3D-printed biped robot with distributed joint control")

The biped robot was designed from scratch: all mechanical, electronic, and control designs were built by the authors. 

Below are descriptions of the directories in the repository: 
1. 3D Model: This contains the SolidWorks parts and assemblies which was 3D-printed and laser cut. 
2. PCB Schematic and Layout: This contains EAGLE schematic and layout files for both the master and joint controllers. 
3. Joint Controller: This is the MPLAB X project used for motor control for the joint controller. 
4. Master Controller: This is the MPLAB X project used for motion control of the biped for the master controller. 

Additional details can be provided upon request. 

This project was developed at Electrical and Electronics Engineering Institute, University of the Philippines Diliman.
